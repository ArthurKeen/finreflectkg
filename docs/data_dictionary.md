FinReflectKG is a large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset that provides structured representations of financial relationships, entities, and temporal information extracted from regulatory filings. Each triplet represents a structured fact in the format (entity, relationship, target) with temporal bounds and rich contextual information.

Dataset Structure
Each row contains a single triplet with the following fields:

Core Triplet Components
triplet_id: Unique identifier for each triplet
entity: Named entity (normalized, e.g., "aapl")
entity_type: Entity category (ORG, PERSON, GPE, etc.)
relationship: Relationship type (normalized, e.g., "discloses", "operates_in")
target: Target entity (normalized)
target_type: Target entity category
start_date: Relationship start date (Month YYYY format)
end_date: Relationship end date (Month YYYY or "default_end_timestamp")
extraction_type: Extraction method ("default" or "extracted")
Document Metadata
ticker: Company ticker symbol (e.g., "aapl", "msft")
year: Filing year
source_file: Original PDF filename
page_id: PDF page identifier

Temporal Information
Temporal Fields Explained
FinReflectKG employs sophisticated temporal extraction to capture when relationships occur or are valid. The temporal information consists of:

Start Date & End Date
Format: "Month YYYY" (e.g., "January 2024", "March 2023")
Purpose: Captures the temporal validity period of each relationship
Default Timestamps
When explicit temporal information cannot be reliably extracted from the text context:

default_start_timestamp: Used when no explicit start date is mentioned or inferable
default_end_timestamp: Used when no explicit end date is mentioned or inferable
Examples:

Extracted: "Environmental spending was approximately $21 million in fiscal 2014" → start_date: "January 2014", end_date: "December 2014"
Default: "Cintas depends on multiple suppliers" → start_date: "January 2014" (filing year), end_date: "default_end_timestamp"
Extraction Type Classification
The extraction_type field indicates the reliability and source of temporal information:

"extracted"
When: Both start_date AND end_date are successfully extracted from the text
Example: Financial metrics with specific fiscal periods, dated announcements, time-bounded events
"default"
When: Either start_date OR end_date (or both) uses default values
Example: General operational relationships, ongoing business activities without specified timeframes
Example Usage
Loading the Dataset
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load the complete dataset
dataset = load_dataset("domyn/FinReflectKG")

# Access the data
triplets = dataset["train"]
print(f"Dataset size: {len(triplets):,} triplets")

# Example triplet
example = triplets[0]
print(f"Entity: {example['entity']}")
print(f"Relationship: {example['relationship']}")  
print(f"Target: {example['target']}")
print(f"Context: {example['chunk_text'][:200]}...")

Filtering by Company
# Filter for Apple (AAPL) triplets
apple_data = dataset["train"].filter(lambda x: x["ticker"] == "aapl")
print(f"Apple triplets: {len(apple_data):,}")

Filtering by Time Period
# Filter for recent years (2022-2024)
recent_data = dataset["train"].filter(lambda x: x["year"] >= 2022)
print(f"Recent triplets: {len(recent_data):,}")

Filtering by Relationship Type
# Find all "discloses" relationships
disclosure_data = dataset["train"].filter(lambda x: x["relationship"] == "discloses")
print(f"Disclosure triplets: {len(disclosure_data):,}")
